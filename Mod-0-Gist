No nothing additional with my current understanding of the data types.

Asking Technical Questions (Check for Understanding) 
-What are the steps you will take when asking a technical question? 
The 4 steps I will take when asking a question is 
1. What were you trying to do? 2. What were you expecting to happen? 3. What resulted instead? 4. What have you attempted so far?
-We lay out these steps in a particular order. What do you think the reasoning behind this might be? 
Understanding what you're trying to accomplish is the first step. 
Then realizing what parts you're failling will help others not go through the same mistakes as well as catching up on all the work you've done already.

Writing the steps in my notes and referring back to them frequently

I'll still have to learn how to go to previous iterations of git and just practicing all newly learned commands. Going back through my notes
