No nothing additional with my current understanding of the data types.

DTR Prep
How would you describe your preferred working style? (Alone,in groups, etc.)
Combining autonomous work with teamwork is my favorite working style. I appreciate the independence that comes with working alone,
but I also appreciate the creativity and problem-solving that come from collaboration.

What strengths do you bring to a team?
I am a good communicator, problem solver, and adapter in a group environment. I can listen to others' viewpoints and convey ideas clearly,
which promotes a cooperative and upbeat atmosphere. Along with my ability to analyze complicated problems and come up with innovative solutions,
I also have the flexibility to adjust to shifting priorities or project requirements.

Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous group project settings? What can you do to either ensure those best practices carry over into projects here or to avoid common
pitfalls that might come up?
In past collaborative initiatives, communication was critical to success. Clear and consistent communication ensures that everyone is on the same page
and tasks are accomplished efficiently. Furthermore, establishing clear goals and expectations from the start helps keep the project on track.


How do you prefer to handle disagreements that come up? (Yes, they will come up!)
Disagreements are unavoidable in any team environment, but I believe they may be useful when handled properly. I prefer to approach arguments with an open mind,
carefully listening to others' perspectives and looking for common ground. I'm willing to compromise when required, but I also stand up for my own views and opinions when
I believe they're correct.


How do you communicate best? What tools do you need to communicate well with your teammates?
I communicate most effectively when I use both written and vocal communication. Email, chat platforms, and video conversations are all successful avenues of communication for me.
Regular check-ins or meetings with coworkers also help to ensure that everyone is up to date and on the same page about project goals and progress.


How do you prefer to receive feedback? How do you prefer to give feedback?
I prefer to hear feedback in a positive and specific manner. I value honest feedback that allows me to find areas for development and advance professionally. 
Similarly, while providing feedback, I aim to be constructive and encouraging, emphasizing specific actions or habits rather than personal judgment.


What scheduling constraints do you have? What are your preferred work times outside of normal school hours?
In terms of schedule, I prefer to work during regular business hours, but I am also adaptable and can work occasional late or weekend shifts if necessary. Clear communication and forward preparation can help to reduce schedule disputes and accommodate everyone's desired work hours.


Calendaring 
1. Because I'm on ET, I'd like to be able to pre-teach the upcoming lesson before it is given. I want to devote two hours every morning.
2. I want to spend my evenings reviewing classes. 
3. I'd like to spend the majority of my weekend on projects.
4. An hour at the gym every day and hours on weekends to pursue my hobbies. 
5. I want to spend my weekends being productive without pushing myself to burnout.
